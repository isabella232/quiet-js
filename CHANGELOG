v1.0.0
- Break quietjs into separate modules.
- Removed profile fetching; now it is in its own module.
- Each transmitter and receiver creates its own audio context.
- Receiver takes in a profile object; it no longer takes in a key to look at a
  preloaded json
- Receiver no longer calls getUserMedia; an audio stream must be passed in. As a
  result, onCreate and onCreateFail callbacks are gone.
- The global destroy function for all receivers is gone. The creator is
  resonsible for maintaining a reference to the receivers and cleaning them up.
- Transmitter takes in a profile object; it no longer takes in a key to look at
  a preloaded json
- Transmitter has clampFrame set to false by default.
- Transmitter#frameLength has been replaced with Transmitter#getFrameLength
